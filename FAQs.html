                              Polytechnic University-
                              Pomona,

                  <p>I have worked with Agile/SCRUM and Waterfall Development.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <h4>6. How does Grant incorporate user feedback into his projects?</h4>
                  <p>Whenever I start a new project, I design it under the assumption that the project
                        won't be perfect from everyone's perspective. This helps me to be more open and ready to receive
                        the feedback
                        regardless of whether or not it is positive or negative.</p>
                  <p>If the feedback turns out to be
                        negative (meaning the project might need some adjustments), I analyze the feedback to determine
                        if the project really warrents these adjustments. If so, I seek out or create a solution to make
                        my projects
                        stronger. In turn, I learn how to apply my skills in more professional and efficient ways. </p>
